# Notes on The Beginner's Guide to React

### For study group use

This is for our study group at Margarita Humanitarian Foundation. We're a nonprofit and need to improve our React skills, and we wanted to take notes on the course [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) using[ https://github.com/eggheadio-projects/the-beginners-guide-to-react](%20https://github.com/eggheadio-projects/the-beginners-guide-to-react) as a starting point.

### Note

The repo this was forked from said: DEPRECATED ⚠️ This notes repo has been moved to eggheadio/notes!

We tried forking https://github.com/eggheadio/eggheadio-course-notes but it wasn't displaying properly in GitBook, so we decided to try with the old repo.
